Project Title: Role Swap

Project Idea and Brief Description:

Role Swap is an interactive simulation application designed to provide users with a unique opportunity to experience and understand various predefined professional roles. The core idea is to immerse users in a series of realistic scenarios pertinent to a chosen role. As users navigate these scenarios, they will be presented with multiple-choice questions or decision points. Their responses will guide the narrative flow and lead to different outcomes.

The primary objective of Role Swap is to assess a user's aptitude, decision-making skills, and understanding of the challenges and responsibilities associated with a particular role. Based on their choices and the outcomes, the application will provide a comprehensive assessment, offering insights into their strengths and areas for improvement within that role. This project aims to be a valuable tool for career exploration, skill development, and self-assessment, allowing individuals to 'try on' different career paths in a safe, simulated environment.

Day-by-Day Capstone Journey Plan

This plan outlines the key activities and milestones for the "Role Swap" capstone project, leading up to a functional prototype.

Phase 1: Planning \& Design

Day 1: Project Proposal \& Initial Plan Submission

Finalize and submit the project title: "Role Swap."

Refine and submit the project idea and brief description.

Submit the detailed day-by-day project plan (this document).

Initial research on interactive storytelling frameworks or libraries (if applicable).

Day 2: Low-Fidelity Prototyping

Sketch out the main user flows (e.g., role selection, scenario progression, decision points, assessment display).

Create wireframes for key screens (e.g., home page, role selection, scenario screen, results screen).

Define the structure of at least one role's scenarios and decision trees.

Gather initial content ideas for scenarios and choices.

Day 3: High-Fidelity Prototyping

Translate low-fidelity wireframes into high-fidelity mockups using a design tool (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD).

Design the user interface (UI) elements, including color schemes, typography, and iconography.

Create interactive prototypes to simulate user experience and gather early feedback.

Refine scenario content and assessment criteria based on design considerations.

Phase 2: Setup \& Core Development

Day 4: Git Repository Setup \& Basic Project Structure

Initialize a new Git Repository for the project.
