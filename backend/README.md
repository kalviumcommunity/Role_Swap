Project Title: Role Swap

Project Idea and Brief Description:

Role Swap is an interactive simulation application designed to provide users with a unique opportunity to experience and understand various predefined professional roles. The core idea is to immerse users in a series of realistic scenarios pertinent to a chosen role. As users navigate these scenarios, they will be presented with multiple-choice questions or decision points. Their responses will guide the narrative flow and lead to different outcomes.

The primary objective of Role Swap is to assess a user's aptitude, decision-making skills, and understanding of the challenges and responsibilities associated with a particular role. Based on their choices and the outcomes, the application will provide a comprehensive assessment, offering insights into their strengths and areas for improvement within that role. This project aims to be a valuable tool for career exploration, skill development, and self-assessment, allowing individuals to 'try on' different career paths in a safe, simulated environment.

Day-by-Day Capstone Journey Plan

This plan outlines the key activities and milestones for the "Role Swap" capstone project, leading up to a functional prototype.

Day 1: Project Proposal \& Initial Plan Submission

Finalize and submit the project title: "Role Swap."

Refine and submit the project idea and brief description.

Submit the detailed day-by-day project plan (this document).

Initial research on interactive storytelling frameworks or libraries (if applicable).

Day 2: Low-Fidelity Prototyping

Sketch out the main user flows (e.g., role selection, scenario progression, decision points, assessment display).

Create wireframes for key screens (e.g., home page, role selection, scenario screen, results screen).

Define the structure of at least one role's scenarios and decision trees.

Gather initial content ideas for scenarios and choices.

Day 3: High-Fidelity Prototyping

Translate low-fidelity wireframes into high-fidelity mockups using a design tool (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD).

Design the user interface (UI) elements, including color schemes, typography, and iconography.

Create interactive prototypes to simulate user experience and gather early feedback.

Refine scenario content and assessment criteria based on design considerations.


Day 4: Git Repository Setup \& Basic Project Structure

Initialize a new Git Repository for the project.

Day 5: Manage all daily tasks and project milestone progress via github projects

Initialize all daily tasks of the project so it will be easy to check the timeline 

Day 6: GET API used

We create a Branch locally and then create GET end points for your project later commit Changes and Push the Branch to GitHub and create a new PR with that Branch after that Submit the PR Link.

Day 7: POST API used

We create a Branch locally and then create POST end points for your project commit Changes and Push the Branch to GitHub and create a new PR with that Branch later submit the PR Link.

Day 8: PUT API used

We create a Branch locally and then create PUT end points for your project commit Changes and Push the Branch to GitHub and create a new PR with that Branch later submit the PR Link.

Day 9: Deployed backend server

Login with Render.com using your kalvium community google account and deploy your Capstone Project on render.

Day 10: Database schema created

Create a Branch locally and create Database models along with schema and Commit Changes and Push the Branch to GitHub later Create a new PR with that Branch and Submit the PR Link.
